## 🌱 Project Philosophy

Silver Talon is a **learning-focused open-source project**.

The main goals are:

- To write clean and understandable code
- To learn by building real features
- To grow together as a community

Mistakes are okay. Learning from them is the point.

## ⚠️ Important Note on AI Usage

AI tools are allowed **only as helpers**.

You may use AI to:

- Understand concepts
- Debug errors
- Get ideas or explanations

You **must not**:

- Copy-paste AI-generated code directly
- Submit code you do not understand

> If you cannot explain your code, it should not be submitted.

This rule exists to ensure genuine learning and fair contributions.
